You should read the [corresponding section of Neel's glossary](https://dynalist.io/d/n2ZWtnoYHrU1s4vnFSAQ519J#z=_Jzi6YHRHKP1JziwdE02qdYZ), before continuing. This [LessWrong post](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/TvrfY4c9eaGLeyDkE/induction-heads-illustrated) might also help; it contains some diagrams (like the one below) which walk through the induction mechanism step by step."

        "This is a demo notebook for [TransformerLens](https://github.com/neelnanda-io/TransformerLens), **a library I ([Neel Nanda](neelnanda.io)) wrote for doing [mechanistic interpretability](https://distill.pub/2020/circuits/zoom-in/) of GPT-2 Style language models.** The goal of mechanistic interpretability is to take a trained model and reverse engineer the algorithms the model learned during training from its weights. It is a fact about the world today that we have computer programs that can essentially speak English at a human level (GPT-3, PaLM, etc), yet we have no idea how they work nor how to write one ourselves. This offends me greatly, and I would like to solve this! Mechanistic interpretability is a very young and small field, and there are a *lot* of open problems - if you would like to help, please try working on one! **Check out my [list of concrete open problems](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WONBzNqfKIxERejrrPlQMyKqg7jSFW92x5UMXNrMdPo/edit#) to figure out where to start.**\n",
        "\n",
        "I wrote this library because after I left the Anthropic interpretability team and started doing independent research, I got extremely frustrated by the state of open source tooling. There's a lot of excellent infrastructure like HuggingFace and DeepSpeed to *use* or *train* models, but very little to dig into their internals and reverse engineer how they work. **This library tries to solve that**, and to make it easy to get into the field even if you don't work at an industry org with real infrastructure! The core features were heavily inspired by [Anthropic's excellent Garcon tool](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2021/garcon/index.html). Credit to Nelson Elhage and Chris Olah for building Garcon and showing me the value of good infrastructure for accelerating exploratory research!\n",
        "\n",
        "The core design principle I've followed is to enable exploratory analysis - one of the most fun parts of mechanistic interpretability compared to normal ML is the extremely short feedback loops! The point of this library is to keep the gap between having an experiment idea and seeing the results as small as possible, to make it easy for **research to feel like play** and to enter a flow state. This notebook demonstrates how the library works and how to use it, but if you want to see how well it works for exploratory research, check out [my notebook analysing Indirect Objection Identification](https://github.com/neelnanda-io/TransformerLens/blob/main/Exploratory_Analysis_Demo.ipynb) or [my recording of myself doing research](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yo4QvDn-vsU)!"

TransformerLens does this by default, and it can easily trip up new users. Notably, **this includes `model.forward`** (which is what's implicitly used when you do eg `model(\"Hello World\")`). This is called a **Beginning of Sequence (BOS)** token, and it's a special token used to mark the beginning of the sequence. Confusingly, in GPT-2, the End of Sequence (EOS), Beginning of Sequence (BOS) and Padding (PAD) tokens are all the same, `<|endoftext|>` with index `50256`.\n",

        "`prepend_bos` is a bit of a hack, and I've gone back and forth on what the correct default here is. The reason I do this is that transformers tend to treat the first token weirdly - this doesn't really matter in training (where all inputs are >1000 tokens), but this can be a big issue when investigating short prompts! The reason for this is that attention patterns are a probability distribution and so need to add up to one, so to simulate being \"off\" they normally look at the first token. Giving them a BOS token lets the heads rest by looking at that, preserving the information in the first \"real\" token.\n",

        "* They are responsible for a significant loss decrease - so much so that there's a visible bump in the loss curve when they develop (this change in loss can be pretty comparable to the increase in loss from major increases in model size, though this is hard to make an apples-to-apples comparison)\n",
        "* They seem to be responsible for the vast majority of in-context learning - the ability to use far back tokens in the context to predict the next token. This is a significant way in which transformers outperform older architectures like RNNs or LSTMs, and induction heads seem to be a big part of this.\n",

They can act on a layer, and edit the input or output of that layer, or the gradient when applying autodiff. The key difference is that **Hook points** act on *activations* not layers. This means that you can intervene within a layer on each activation, and don't need to care about the precise layer structure of the transformer. And it's immediately clear exactly how the hook's effect is applied. This adjustment was shamelessly inspired by [Garcon's use of ProbePoints](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2021/garcon/index.html).\n",

But if two heads are deliberately composing, then they will likely want to ensure they write and read from similar subspaces, so that minimal information is lost.
